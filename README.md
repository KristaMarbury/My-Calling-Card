# Hi, and Please Check This Out!
Welcome to my portfolio website! This is a "living" website that I'll be editing as I continue to take on projects and update my skills. If you're wondering what's new with me, come and see what's cooking in this kitchen. 

I love using sticky notes whenever I'm working to be productive, and this is exactly like how one of my corkboards would look like. ;)
